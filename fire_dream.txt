I miss the symphonies
Drowning in the apathy
The nights turn to dawns
The rising of the fawn
Seen through my window
I grieving like a widow

Is any life found outside of pain…
Or is existence only insane…

You marked out the heavenly choir
Set the stage, turned the page
While we were but the scream of a dream
Deep within the wells of Your unquenchable fire

HOW can ANYONE say any OTHERS were made amongst the STARS?
like US, like US!
Shooting theories out in time’s LIGHT-SPEED CAR
Why let Bedlam make us fizzle and fuss

For the Uncreated Eternal’s image is what we bear!
Hard to think, easy to carry - yoke so fair!
If the Earth is our destiny, why try to flee?
If Heaven is our eternity, why settle for science-fiction’s dying glee?

O new Creation - higher Station!
O earthen vessel - spirited mammal!
Hard not to ramble, but we are His!
No fiction here… The Truth is so clear!
